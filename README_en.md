With this GEM you can validate and convert Brazilian plates from the old model to the new model used by Mercosul (and vice-versa).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mercosur_plate_converter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mercosur_plate_converter

## Usage

Instantiate MercosurPlateConverter class and use the methods to validate and convert plates.

The example below assumes that you supply a valid Mercosur-type license plate:

```ruby
plate = MercosurPlateConverter::Converter.from_string("ABC1C34")

plate.original_plate #=> "ABC1334"
plate.plate #=> "ABC1234"
plate.type #=> :mercosur
plate.valid? #=> true
plate.mercosur? #=> true
plate.old_brazilian? #=> false
```
